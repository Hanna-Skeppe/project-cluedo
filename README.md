# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

The task was to create a version of the classic board game Cluedo.  It included creating objects and arrays and also connect this to the DOM.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

The overall difficulty I had was to understand how to write the functions and to know how I would write them to make them work. Still very confused about many things when it comes to JS. I tried to write beforehand in text what I wanted to do, but it was still very hard for me to make that into JS code. I got some help from my teammates which was good. Still very much struggling with the basic concepts of JS and how to use them. I have felt behid on this project this week compared to others. But still I have put in many, many hours of work on it. I am not super happy that I'm still not able to understand basic JS as I wished I would. 

Had difficulties to use keyframes animation with before and after and opacity. Hard to know how to get it to show/hide with JS. didn't know how to get the whole of the animation to show and hide. Ended up simplifying the animation and removing the before and after to be able to make it show and hide properly using CSS and JS.

I find it hard to using google and SO to find answers when I get stuck on different things. Sometimes I find answers, but I am unable to implement them in my code.

This week overall has been a struggle for me, but I am nevertheless proud that I managed to finish the project and to complete the red level. The black level seems way out of reach for me at the level I am now.

UPDATE: I worked some more on the code after the code-review and a code coach-session: 
- I made the PLAY AGAIN-button work so the page reloads, which previously didn't work.
- I changed the pickRoom-function so that the room card could only be picked once.
- I made the black level-function to increase chance of favourite weapon on the weapon card to work.
- I also fixed some minor things in CSS, such as the wrapper-image to cover the whole creen on different media queries, and I made the loader centered on the card at all media queries.
- I cleaned the code, removed unused code and made single-line cmments in JS into multi-line.
